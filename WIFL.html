			This site is meant to illustrate what living with mental illness can feel like. It is by no means a place to diagnose yourself or others, but meant to give some clarity to both people with these illnesses, and others who do not. If you have a mental illness, you are not alone, and hopefully others may understand a little beter though this site.

						<h4>Bipolar Disorder</h4>

							<blockquote>
								"During mania, I've got more energy than I know what to do with, and it usually ends with me taking it out sexually." - Sarah, age 34
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"Sometimes, when I'm in the dark place that a low stage gives me, I can't move. I feel sick all the time, and my appetite is completely gone. " - Jake, age 27
							</blockquote>
							<p class="bpd">
								Bipolar Disorder can be tricky to diagnose or even consider, as up and down stages are part of life, and social stigma tells us bipolar disorder means a life of servitude to the illness. Charcterized by periods of high energy and productivity contrasted by low motivation and lethargic periods, dealing with the mental illness is difficult at best.

						<h4>Depression</h4>
						<section class="depimage">
							<img src="images/Depression.jpeg">
						</section>

							
							<blockquote>
								"Everyday is a roll of the dice - I might have to convince myself I deserve to exist or  I might not." - Raye, age 19
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"People keep telling me it's just a phase, that you get over sadness, but I've been like this for three years. It's not going away, and I wish it would stop." - Thomas, age 25
							</blockquote>
							<p class="depression_time">
								Depression is often hard to spot, as many people who have it act cheerful and happy around others to mask it. Sometime, it's easier to pretend it doesn't exsist rather than face the full brunt of depression. 
							<p class="depression_time">
							More often, depression is in stages. Some people may be sad, and others will be so depressed that getting anything done is impossible.

						<h4>Anxiety and Panic Attacks</h4>
							<section class="anx">
								<img src="images/anxiety.jpeg">
							</section>
							
							<blockquote>
								"The world feels like it's falling apart, at the slightest thing. I keep thinking of all th things that could or will happen and I'm paralyzed." - D'angelo, age 28
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"I've passed out from hyperventaliating too much. ACtually just breathign normally is a struggle, because my urge to hyperventalate comes on so strong during the middle of a panic attack. I feel like I'm dying."
							</blockquote>
							<p class="anxiety">
								Anxiety is very common: many people live with a low form of anxiety all the time. In the past, we used it to be alert to predators. But now in modern time, it creates a low level uneasiness all the time. Panic attacks can result, which make certain places or topics off limits to people, due to the reaction it gives them.
